	title = {Drug-Drug Interaction Extraction from Biomedical Text Using Long Short Term Memory Network},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08303},
	abstract = {Simultaneous administration of multiple drugs can have synergistic or antagonistic effects as one drug can affect activities of other drugs. Synergistic effects lead to improved therapeutic outcomes, whereas, antagonistic effects can be life-threatening, may lead to increased healthcare cost, or may even cause death. Thus identification of unknown drug-drug interaction ({DDI}) is an important concern for efficient and effective healthcare. Although multiple resources for {DDI} exist, they are often unable to keep pace with rich amount of information available in fast growing biomedical texts. Most existing methods model {DDI} extraction from text as a classification problem and mainly rely on handcrafted features. Some of these features further depend on domain specific tools. Recently neural network models using latent features have been shown to give similar or better performance than the other existing models dependent on handcrafted features. In this paper, we present three models namely, \{{\textbackslash}it B-{LSTM}\}, \{{\textbackslash}it {AB}-{LSTM}\} and \{{\textbackslash}it Joint {AB}-{LSTM}\} based on long short-term memory ({LSTM}) network. All three models utilize word and position embedding as latent features and thus do not rely on explicit feature engineering. Further use of bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-{LSTM}) networks allow implicit feature extraction from the whole sentence. The two models, \{{\textbackslash}it {AB}-{LSTM}\} and \{{\textbackslash}it Joint {AB}-{LSTM}\} also use attentive pooling in the output of Bi-{LSTM} layer to assign weights to features. Our experimental results on the {SemEval}-2013 {DDI} extraction dataset show that the \{{\textbackslash}it Joint {AB}-{LSTM}\} model outperforms all the existing methods, including those relying on handcrafted features. The other two proposed {LSTM} models also perform competitively with state-of-the-art methods.},

	title = {{DiSAN}: Directional Self-Attention Network for {RNN}/{CNN}-Free Language Understanding},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04696},
	shorttitle = {{DiSAN}},
	abstract = {Recurrent neural nets ({RNN}) and convolutional neural nets ({CNN}) are widely used on {NLP} tasks to capture the long-term and local dependencies, respectively. Attention mechanisms have recently attracted enormous interest due to their highly parallelizable computation, significantly less training time, and flexibility in modeling dependencies. We propose a novel attention mechanism in which the attention between elements from input sequence(s) is directional and multi-dimensional (i.e., feature-wise). A light-weight neural net, "Directional Self-Attention Network ({DiSAN})", is then proposed to learn sentence embedding, based solely on the proposed attention without any {RNN}/{CNN} structure. {DiSAN} is only composed of a directional self-attention with temporal order encoded, followed by a multi-dimensional attention that compresses the sequence into a vector representation. Despite its simple form, {DiSAN} outperforms complicated {RNN} models on both prediction quality and time efficiency. It achieves the best test accuracy among all sentence encoding methods and improves the most recent best result by 1.02\% on the Stanford Natural Language Inference ({SNLI}) dataset, and shows state-of-the-art test accuracy on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank ({SST}), Multi-Genre natural language inference ({MultiNLI}), Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge ({SICK}), Customer Review, {MPQA}, {TREC} question-type classification and Subjectivity ({SUBJ}) datasets.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762},
	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 {BLEU} on the {WMT} 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 {BLEU}. On the {WMT} 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art {BLEU} score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight {GPUs}, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Several studies have been conducted to explore the implications of this use on patient education, the physician-patient relationship, and diagnosis/decision making. In order to better understand the current and future implications of Internet use on patient care activities, it is important to know the Internet sources physicians prefer to consult. The objective of this study was to determine the Internet sources of information physicians most often use to gather medical information. This study demonstrated that the vast majority of physicians indicate they access a targeted site rather than utilize a search engine (such as Google) to gather medical information. Of the targeted site types, most physicians indicate they use 1) edited/secondary data sources as their primary medical information data retrieving, 2) about one quarter of the physicians surveyed indicated research databases which provide access to medical journal publications 3) a minority of physicians use sites dedicated to their specialized area and 4) a small percentage use medical web site portals.},
